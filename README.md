# Data_Driven_School_District_Insights

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, the primary mission is to assist the school board and the mayor in making strategic decisions that will shape the future of the schools. The initial task at hand is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of district-wide standardized test results and extract key insights that can guide budget allocation and educational priorities.

District Summary:
  * Calculate and compile a high-level overview of critical district metrics.
  * Metrics to include: total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math score, average reading         score, % passing math, % passing reading, % overall passing (students passing both math and reading).

School Summary:
  * Generate detailed summaries for each school within the district.
  * Metrics to include: school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math           score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, % overall passing.

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):
  * Identify and present the top-performing schools based on % overall passing.
  * Provide insights into what sets these schools apart.

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):
  * Identify and present the lowest-performing schools based on % overall passing.
  * Investigate factors contributing to lower performance.

Math Scores by Grade:
  * Calculate and create a DataFrame showing average math scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at      each school.

Reading Scores by Grade:
  * Generate a DataFrame displaying average reading scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each       school.

Scores by School Spending:
  * Organize school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
  * Utilize pre-defined bins and calculate mean scores per spending range.
  * Metrics to include: average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, % overall passing.

Scores by School Size:
  * Categorize schools into size categories (small, medium, large) based on total student population.
  * Analyze performance variations among different school sizes.

Scores by School Type:
  * Utilize the per_school_summary DataFrame to create a new DataFrame showcasing school performance based on "School Type"       (e.g., district or charter).

The project will equip district stakeholders with data-driven insights that will facilitate informed decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. By harnessing the power of data, this analysis aims to enhance the educational landscape within the district and improve student outcomes.
